## About
Flourish is a visual artist showcase and profile application where you can find a visual artist based on their genre of art.
The Flourish application was envisioned as a community of artists with a shared interest of profiling their work for the art connosieur in an environment free of oversaturation from non-art entities and excessive advertisements. 

As an artist Flourish is the perfect profile application, as the reach obtained is from a genre-based standpoint, meaning the artist will garner a following based on a genre specific query. The artist can also share contact information for users to reach them directly.

As a user Flourish is a unique way to expose yourself to new artists. The idea is that the user is exposed to new artists based on the genre of art instead of searching the artists by name. This allows a source of exposure for the user to artists they may not have previously located based on the sourcing of artists via genre.  

## Overview

#### User Experience
As a user at the home page, you will be prompted to create a username and password. Once you have created the username, you will be directed to the user page.

## Documentation
For the sake of generating enough seed data, we created some fake portfolios.  Each of us are artists ourselves and created portfolios with our own names and multiple alias names.  Some portfolios were made using free stock images by artists on Pexel.com and Pixabay.com.  We would like to credit these artists as their work is extroadinary. Any portfolios not mentioned below are real contributing artists that the developers know.

 - Pamela Agrast is also Halley Ween and Jean Ver Hulst.
 - David Agrast (Pamela Agrast's husband) is also Julian Agrast.
 - Sarah Leder is also Onion Runyon and Ashley Smith

Additional Artists Referenced in the Seeding Process:

Additionally we used works by renown painter Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, and Edouard Manet.  Information and images were used from https://useum.org/.

## Comments from the DevTeam
In the early phase of planning and initial setup of the project, the team worked together in creating the basic framework of the app and coded as a team using a collaborative approach. Once the skeleton of the app was structured the group was able to separate concerns and focus on various components for continuous development to meet a specific deadline. While concerns were separated, the group was able to continue to collaborate on issues as they arose. During the deploy process there were issues with image links for which the approach of data storage was called into question. The group came together with addiitional resources to implement a solution.

## Future Developments
Below are the future developmental plans mapped out for the application as we move into the next phases of the projects: 
- A search bar for users to search for an artist they have previously located
- A further developed user dashboard where they have capabilities of storing their favorite artists
- Expanded capability for additional images to render for each profile   
- Artist Login and Dashboard to Manage the Profile
