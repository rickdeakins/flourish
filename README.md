# flourish: A Visual Artist Showcase



For the sake of generating enough seed data, we created some fake portfolios.  Each of us are artists ourselves and created portfolios with our own names and multiple alias names.  Some portfolios were made using free stock images by artists on Pexel.com and Pixabay.com.  We would like to credit these artists as their work is extroadinary. Any portfolios not mentioned below are real contributing artists that the developers know.

Pamela Agrast is also Halley Ween and Jean Ver Hulst.
David Agrast (Pamela Agrast's husband) is also Julian Agrast.
Sarah Leder is also Onion Runyon and Ashley Smith


John Jacobs' images are from an artist named Steve Johnson.  You can access his work here:
